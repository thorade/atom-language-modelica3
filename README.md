# atom-language-modelica3

This package was created using an automatic conversion  
**`Sublime Text → TextMaker → Atom.io`**

The original Sublime Text package is here:  
https://github.com/BorisChumichev/modelicaSublimeTextPackage  
All credits for creating that package go to [@BorisChumichev](https://github.com/BorisChumichev).

The first conversion step  
**`Sublime Text → TextMaker`**  
was done using the ant script and XML/XSL files from  
https://github.com/srbs/textmate-to-sublime-converter  
Credits for that conversion script go to [@srbs](https://github.com/srbs).

The second conversion step  
**`TextMaker → Atom.io`**  
can be done using the Atom.io package manager `apm`
