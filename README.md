# atom-language-modelica3

This repository here is the result of an automatic conversion  
**`Sublime Text → TextMaker → Atom.io`**
Parts of the results were contributed to the new "official" Modelica Atom package at  
https://github.com/modelica-tools/atom-language-modelica

The original Sublime Text package created by [@BorisChumichev](https://github.com/BorisChumichev). is here:  
https://github.com/BorisChumichev/modelicaSublimeTextPackage  

The first conversion step  
**`Sublime Text → TextMaker`**  
was done using the ant script and XML/XSL files from  
https://github.com/srbs/textmate-to-sublime-converter  
Credits for that conversion script go to [@srbs](https://github.com/srbs).

The second conversion step  
**`TextMaker → Atom.io`**  
can be done using the Atom.io package manager `apm`
